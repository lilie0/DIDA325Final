i used a dataset from the uci ml repository to build models that predict whether a student will drop out of university or not. i've included the R notebook and the dataset, and a report is available per request. 

the dataset was found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
