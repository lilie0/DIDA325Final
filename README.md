i used a dataset from the uci ml repository to build a model that predicts whether a student will drop out of university or not. i've included the R code and the dataset, but a report is available per requeset. 

the dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success
